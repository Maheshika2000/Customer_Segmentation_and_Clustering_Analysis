# Customer_Segmentation_and_Clustering_Analysis

Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to divide customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behaviors, allowing businesses to better understand customer needs, target marketing strategies, and improve customer experience.

By applying unsupervised machine learning, we discover meaningful customer groups without prior labels, enabling data-driven business decisions.

Objectives

Preprocess and clean customer data.

Apply feature scaling to normalize numerical values.

Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Determine the optimal number of clusters using:

Elbow Method

Silhouette Score

Visualize customer segments using 2D and 3D plots.

Derive business insights from identified clusters.
